# Generative ML and LangChain Experiments

This repo is a collection of notebooks which contain experiments with generative ML and
[LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/). Specifically, how these models and 
methods can be applied to municipal legislative data such as the data produced by 
[Council Data Project](https://councildataproject.org).

Additionally, there are some reading notes and links to literature reviews and
foundational papers for various tasks (summarization, text generation, etc.).
